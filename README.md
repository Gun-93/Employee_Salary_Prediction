# Employee Salary Prediction using Random Forest
This project aims to predict employee salaries based on features like age, education level, job title, experience, location, and more. A machine learning model 
(Random Forest Regressor) is trained to make fair and data-driven salary predictions.

## Problem Statement
In many companies, deciding how much salary an employee should get depends on things like their job, education, experience, and location. 
But this process can be confusing and unfair sometimes. So, in this project, we are making a model that can predict salary based on these details. 
It helps HR teams make better and fair salary decisions using data.

## Technologies Used
- Python 
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Streamlit (for web app)
- Code Editor-Vs Code

## Steps to Run Locally
Streamlit run Salary_app.py

# Model Details
RÂ² Score:0.9868
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): $3,538.28
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): $4,696.25
Custom Accuracy: 95.56%

# Conclusion
We built a model to predict employee salaries using the Random Forest algorithm.
It uses information like job role, education, experience, and location to estimate salary.
The model gave good accuracy and helps in making salary decisions in a fair and smart way.
While working, we faced some small issues like missing values and text data, but we fixed them.
In the future, we can make this better by:
       1.Adding more real-life data
       2.Using other ML models for comparison
       3.Making a website or app for easy use

# future scope 
Use more data to make the model smarter and more accurate.
Try other ML models like deep learning for better results.
Add more details like company name, skills, and job type to improve prediction.
Make a mobile or web app so anyone can use it easily.
Live prediction feature can be added for real-time use.
